# How to Use the 3D Preview - Step by Step Guide

## 📍 Where is the 3D Preview?

The 3D preview is located at the **bottom of the designer page** (`/draw`). It's the light gray area below the 2D canvas that shows a 3D model of your window or door design.

2. Click **"Open Designer 🎨"** button
3. You'll see the designer interface with:
   - Left sidebar: Controls and options
   - Center: 2D interactive canvas
   - Bottom: 3D preview (light gray area)

### **Step 2: Create or Modify a Design**
1. Use the left sidebar to adjust:
   - **Type**: Choose Window or Door
   - **Template**: Select a template (Single, Double, Sliding, etc.)

   - **Color**: Pick a color
   - **Hardware**: Select handles, hinges, locks
   - **Extended Components**: Add sills, mosquito nets, glass films

2. As you make changes, the 3D preview **automatically updates** to show your design in 3D!

### **Step 3: Interact with the 3D Preview**

#### **🖱️ Mouse Controls (Desktop)**

**A. Rotate the View (Most Common)**
1. Move your mouse cursor **into the 3D preview area** (the gray box at the bottom)
2. **Left-click** and **hold down** the mouse button
3. **Drag** the mouse while holding:
   - Drag **left/right** → Rotates around horizontally
   - Drag **up/down** → Rotates vertically
   - Drag **diagonally** → Rotates in multiple directions
4. **Release** the mouse button to stop rotating

**Example**: Click and drag left → Your design spins to the left, showing different angles.

**B. Zoom In/Out**
1. Move your mouse cursor **over the 3D preview area**
2. **Scroll up** on your mouse wheel → Zooms in (gets closer)
3. **Scroll down** on your mouse wheel → Zooms out (gets farther)

**Example**: Scroll up 3-4 times → Your design appears much larger and closer.

---

**C. Pan/Move the View**
1. Move your mouse cursor **into the 3D preview area**
2. **Right-click** and **hold down** the mouse button
3. **Drag** the mouse → Moves the view sideways/up/down
4. **Release** to stop

**Example**: Right-click and drag right → The design slides to the left, revealing more space around it.

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### **Tip 1: Start with a Simple Design**
- Select "Single" window template
- Set dimensions: 1200mm × 1500mm
- Choose Aluminum material
- Watch the 3D preview update automatically!

### **Tip 2: Check Different Angles**
- Rotate to see:
  - **Front view**: Shows the window from the front
  - **Side view**: Shows the depth/frame thickness
  - **Top view**: Shows the window from above
  - **Isometric view**: Shows 3D perspective

### **Tip 3: Zoom to See Details**
- Zoom in to see:
  - Frame details
  - Glass panels
  - Hardware placement
  - Material textures

### **Tip 4: Compare Templates**
1. Select "Single" template → See in 3D
2. Change to "Double" template → See the difference in 3D
3. Try "Bay" or "Bow" → See how complex windows look!

### **Tip 5: Real-time Updates**
- Change the **width** → 3D preview updates instantly
- Change the **height** → 3D preview updates instantly
- Change the **color** → 3D preview updates instantly

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### **Problem: 3D preview is black/dark**
- **Solution**: This was fixed! It should now be light gray.

### **Problem: Can't rotate/drag doesn't work**
- **Solution**: Make sure you're clicking **inside the 3D preview area** (the gray box at bottom)
- Make sure you're using **left mouse button** (not right button)
- Try refreshing the page

### **Problem: Design doesn't show in 3D**
- **Solution**: Check that:
  1. Dimensions are set (width and height > 0)
  2. Glass is enabled (if you want to see glass)
  3. Try changing template or dimensions to refresh

### **Problem: 3D view is too close or too far**
- **Solution**: 
  1. Scroll to zoom out if too close
  2. Scroll to zoom in if too far
  3. Use right-click + drag to pan and adjust position
